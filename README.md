# Project Name: AcroMate
Tired of wondering what acronym means, find it here.

## Introduction
This project is born out of a personal and professional necessity - to demystify the world of acronyms and abbreviations. It serves a dual purpose: firstly, as a practical tool to navigate the often confusing sea of shortened forms found in documents and workplace communication. Secondly, it's a journey of learning and solidifying my skills in Golang, complemented by exploring the realms of HTMX and Tailwind CSS. 

- **What problem does it solve?**
  The project addresses the common frustration of encountering acronyms and abbreviations in professional settings or technical documents and not knowing their meanings. It's particularly useful for anyone new to a job, field, or even a country, where such abbreviations are frequently used without explanation.

- **Who is it for?**
  It's designed for professionals, students, and anyone who, like me, finds themselves puzzled by the myriad of acronyms and abbreviations encountered in daily work or study. It's also a tool for personal growth and reference, helping users to quickly compile and understand company-specific or industry-specific jargon.

- **What does it do?**
  The project offers a user-friendly platform to search, understand, and learn various acronyms and abbreviations. Users can contribute by adding new terms, making it a collaborative and ever-growing resource. The aim is to make this tool a personal aide in untangling the web of short forms, thereby enhancing understanding and communication in professional environments.
